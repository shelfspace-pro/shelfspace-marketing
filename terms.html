<section class="legal-section">
  <div class="legal-container">
    <p class="legal-effective">Effective Date: February 25, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("you" or "User") and ShelfSpace Technologies Inc. ("ShelfSpace," "we," "us," or "our") governing your access to and use of the ShelfSpace platform at <a href="https://ourshelf.space">ourshelf.space</a>, the website at <a href="https://shelfspace.pro">shelfspace.pro</a>, and all related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>
    <p>By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of a business entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>To use the Service, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>
      <li>Be capable of forming a binding contract under applicable law</li>
      <li>Operate a legally licensed business in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including all laws and regulations applicable to the cannabis industry in your jurisdiction</li>
      <li>Not be prohibited from using the Service under any applicable law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to cannabis licensing, tracking, and reporting requirements in your state.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To access the Service, you must create an account and provide accurate, current, and complete information. You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials</li>
      <li>Promptly update your account information if it changes</li>
      <li>Accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account</li>
      <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that contain inaccurate information or that we reasonably believe violate these Terms.</p>

    <h2>4. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>ShelfSpace provides a platform that facilitates scan-based trading (consignment) between retailers and vendors. The Service includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consignment contract management between retailers and vendors</li>
      <li>Inventory tracking and management tools</li>
      <li>Automated settlement calculations based on point-of-sale data</li>
      <li>Weekly settlement processing and reporting</li>
      <li>Business analytics and reporting dashboards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ShelfSpace acts solely as a Payment Technology Provider and Administrative Agent for the limited purpose of generating payment instruments. <strong>ShelfSpace is not a buyer, seller, consignor, retailer, distributor, or merchant of record with respect to any products, and is not a party to any inventory financing relationship between retailers and vendors.</strong> ShelfSpace never takes possession, custody, or control of any funds or inventory associated with the sale of products. ShelfSpace does not act as a fiduciary, escrow agent, trustee, or financial intermediary for any party, and owes no fiduciary duties to any user of the platform.</p>

    <h2>5. Scan-Based Trading and Settlements</h2>

    <h3>5.1 How It Works</h3>
    <p>Under the scan-based trading model facilitated by ShelfSpace, vendors place products on consignment with retailers. Retailers pay vendors only for products sold to end consumers, as reported through integrated POS systems. Settlements are calculated and processed on a weekly basis.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Settlement Accuracy</h3>
    <p>Settlement calculations are based on sales data received from integrated POS systems. While we strive for accuracy, ShelfSpace does not guarantee that POS data is error-free. Both retailers and vendors are responsible for reviewing settlement reports and promptly reporting any discrepancies.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Payment Processing</h3>
    <p>ShelfSpace facilitates the calculation and reporting of settlements. The actual transfer of funds between retailers and vendors may be processed through third-party payment services. ShelfSpace is not responsible for delays or errors caused by third-party payment processors, banking institutions, or the failure of any party to remit payment.</p>

    <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms</li>
      <li>Provide accurate business, product, and transaction information</li>
      <li>Maintain all licenses, permits, and regulatory approvals required for your business operations</li>
      <li>Comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including cannabis regulations</li>
      <li>Not use the Service to facilitate transactions involving products that are illegal in your jurisdiction</li>
      <li>Not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other accounts, or our systems</li>
      <li>Not interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers and networks connected to the Service</li>
      <li>Not use the Service to transmit any malicious code, viruses, or harmful content</li>
      <li>Not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Fees and Pricing</h2>
    <p>Current pricing and fees are described on our <a href="/pricing">Pricing page</a>. We reserve the right to change our fees at any time with reasonable notice. Continued use of the Service after a fee change constitutes acceptance of the new fees.</p>
    <p>During the pilot program, access to the Service may be offered at no cost. We reserve the right to introduce fees upon conclusion of the pilot program with at least thirty (30) days' notice.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>

    <h3>8.1 Our Property</h3>
    <p>The Service, including all software, designs, text, graphics, logos, and other content, is owned by ShelfSpace and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service without our prior written consent.</p>

    <h3>8.2 Your Data</h3>
    <p>You retain ownership of all data you submit to the Service ("User Data"). By using the Service, you grant ShelfSpace a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, process, and display your User Data solely as necessary to provide and improve the Service.</p>

    <h3>8.3 Feedback</h3>
    <p>If you provide suggestions, ideas, or feedback about the Service, we may use that feedback without any obligation to you.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</strong></p>
    <p>ShelfSpace does not warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free</li>
      <li>The results obtained from the Service will be accurate or reliable</li>
      <li>Any errors in the Service will be corrected</li>
      <li>The Service will meet your specific requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ShelfSpace does not provide legal, tax, financial, or regulatory advice. You are solely responsible for determining whether your use of the Service complies with applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SHELFSPACE AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SHELFSPACE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>IN NO EVENT SHALL SHELFSPACE'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO SHELFSPACE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</strong></p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ShelfSpace and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use of the Service</li>
      <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
      <li>Your violation of any applicable law or regulation</li>
      <li>Your violation of any third-party rights</li>
      <li>Disputes between retailers and vendors on the platform</li>
      <li>Any products placed on consignment through the Service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <h3>12.1 Governing Law</h3>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Subject to the arbitration provisions below, any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware, and the parties hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.</p>

    <h3>12.2 Informal Resolution</h3>
    <p>Before filing any formal legal proceedings, you agree to first attempt to resolve any dispute informally by contacting us at <a href="mailto:chris@shelfspace.pro">chris@shelfspace.pro</a>. We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally within sixty (60) days.</p>

    <h3>12.3 Arbitration</h3>
    <p>If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, you and ShelfSpace agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The seat of arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Court proceedings shall be limited to enforcing arbitration awards or seeking provisional relief.</p>

    <h3>12.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
    <p><strong>YOU AND SHELFSPACE AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</strong></p>

    <h3>12.5 Jury Trial Waiver</h3>

    </ul>
    <p>You may terminate your account at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:chris@shelfspace.pro">chris@shelfspace.pro</a>. Termination does not relieve you of any obligations incurred prior to termination, including any outstanding payments.</p>

      <li><strong>Force Majeure</strong> — ShelfSpace shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including natural disasters, acts of government, internet outages, or other force majeure events.</li>
